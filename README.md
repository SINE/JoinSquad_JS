This repository was created to contain a collection of Javascript-based projects and their necessary resources, and is dedicated to JoinSquad.com clientside forum-customization in the visitor's web-browser.
From adding a custom background-image, up to highlighting staff-posts and other geeky useful little things, each one has a dedicated set of functions and features. See for yourself and leave some constructive feedback if you encounter any issues!
